Friends, the game has commenced, and you cannot choose to decline...Nor do you have any reason or grounds to.
The dice are case - Ladies and gentlemen, ready to unveil your card?
I'm putting down the bet.
I'm taking the gamble.
I'm claiming the win.
I'll let fate spin the wheel, a daring gamble.Walking the brink of death...for rebirth.
All for the Amber Lord!
